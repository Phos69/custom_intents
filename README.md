# custom_intents

My custom intents folder, 
The idea is to improve italian (and maybe english) communication with Assist, while also implementing some custom intents which are not currently supported

custom_intents for the following services have been developed:
cover.stop_cover
cover.set_cover_position

also custom sentences to improve italian communication for covers and climate entities:

cover_HassTurnOn
cover_HassTurnOff
climate_HassTurnOn
climate_HassTurnOff
